# JobSniffer
Submission for AI ATL Hackathon.
## Overview
 Job Sniffer is a job application tracking system. This consolidates all your job applications across the globe by accessing all the emails you receive in your inbox. It filters out and traces the job applications you have received in your inbox and then after processing the information using Palm API it updates your user database. The results are displayed, based on the details of the position you applied to and the current status of the application. At each run the application would track the emails obtained during the last 24 hours. This can help you save time during the job hunting process by automatically keeping track of your applications in an organized manner.

 The application would generate a table like that shown below.
